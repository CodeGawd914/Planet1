          -The entire facility is sprayed in between each open play session and party with our BIOPROTECTUs™ Disinfectant. This includes, but is not limited to, the front prize counter, arcade games, toddler section, cafe, jungle gym, all doorknobs, and bathrooms.

          <br></br>
          -Upon entering Planet Play™, temperatures will be taken. Anything over 100.3 will not be permitted in the facility.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          -Upon entering Planet Play™, guests will step into a boot tray that contains a small level of BIOPROTECTUs™. This will disinfect the soles of shoes, eliminating the tracking of germs and viruses into the facility. Additionally, in any area where children may be climbing or crawling, such as the jungle gym and toddler area, shoes are not permitted.
